# Stab Rabbit Travel Investigator

Problem

There is not a good app to map and track places that you have visited or plan to visit with information about the location that combines future travel search integrally (wikipedia, attractions, etc. are all separate apps)

Solution

An app that brings together a map view with a dashboard for trip history and planning for exploration. A consolidated Travel App that displays meaningful data about worldwide destinations - not just a price search tool, nor an encyclopedia)
